This research explores the development of a highly accurate artificial intelligence system for automated academic assessment, focusing on achieving maximum reliability in grading various types of student submissions. The project aims to overcome current limitations in AI grading systems by implementing a multi-layered validation approach combining natural language processing, rubric-based assessment, and human-calibrated learning models.

The research will investigate novel methods including cross-referencing multiple AI models, implementing confidence thresholds, and developing adaptive learning mechanisms that continuously improve accuracy through feedback loops. Special attention will be given to handling edge cases, subjective evaluations, and maintaining consistency across different subject domains.

A key innovation will be the development of a hybrid system that combines traditional rule-based grading with advanced machine learning techniques, while incorporating mechanisms to explain and justify grading decisions for transparency and verification.
